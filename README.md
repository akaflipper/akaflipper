### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I started programming in Basic on a Sinclair ZX Spectrum in the 1980s. I then went on to use an Apple IIe in high school. After serving in the South African Navy, I taught myself HTML and CSS while working at The Natal Witness newspaper
I  converted the news stories from Quark XPress to HTML in Notepad and helped create the newspaper's first website in 1996.
On moving to London I worked at a large personal Finance website and helped take traffic from 20,000 pages per month to a record of 1,000,000 per day during the 1998 Budget speech.

I was a professional photographer for a number of years and as such I programmed in PHP & MySQL on an ad hoc basis from around 2003, and since 2020 on a full time programmer utilising the Laravel framework with Tailwind, AlpineJS and Livewire.
